âœ… Case Study: Task Manager using JavaScript DOM and Array Methods

ðŸŸ© Problem Statement:
Individuals often struggle to stay organized and track tasks effectively throughout the day. Many simple web-based task managers lack real-time interactivity or ease of use.

ðŸŸ¨ Objective:
Develop a simple, interactive Task Manager using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:

Add new tasks
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
Delete tasks dynamically
View updated task lists instantly without reloading the page

ðŸŸ¦ Key Functional Requirements:
Add Task: Users should be able to input a task and add it to a visual list.
Display Task List: Tasks should be rendered as a list using DOM elements.
Toggle Completion: Clicking a button should mark a task as complete or incomplete.
Delete Task: Users should be able to remove a task from the list.
Instant Feedback: All changes should reflect immediately using JavaScript array operations and DOM updates.

ðŸ§° Technical Implementation:
ðŸ”¹ HTML:

Used to structure input fields, buttons, and display area (like a <ul> list).

ðŸ”¹ CSS:

Applied basic styling to enhance user experience and visually indicate task status (e.g., strikethrough for completed tasks).

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript + Array Methods:

Feature	Array Method	Description
Add Task	push()	Add a new task object to the array
Display Tasks	forEach()	Loop through the array and display each task in the DOM
Delete Task	filter()	Remove a task based on index
Mark Complete	Index Access	Toggle completed property on the task object
